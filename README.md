# Veteran Difficulty by Kalightortaio

## WIP currently, working on mobs, will update this soon!

* Drowned swim much faster in water. Lowered trident variant to 10%, from vanilla 15%. Drowned no longer harm each other with Tridents.
* Ghasts cannot die, but drop 1-3 ghast tears upon any taking damage. Their fireballs are also slightly more powerful.
* Phantoms no longer spawn in the overworld. Instead, they spawn naturally in the End, less commonly along with Endermen. They have been retextured to fit the End color palette.
* Endermen have a 20% chance to teleport their target a short distance away. This forced teleportation has a cooldown of 10 seconds, before the effect can trigger again.
* Magma Cubes spawn temporary flowing lava when they are killed. Magma Cream no longer burns in lava or fire.
* Blazes now inflict a new Status Effect called Scalding, which prevents health regeneration, for 15 seconds.
* Skeletons will switch to an iron sword when a player gets within 8 blocks of them, and back to a bow otherwise. Enchantments are preserved on weapon switch.
* Cave Spiders spawn cobwebs and split into baby Cave Spiders when they are killed.
* Slimes jump much further, and no longer take fall damage.
* Wolves are hostile at night, but become neutral during the day. Health of wolves and tamed wolves have been doubled.
* Vexes are now 50% larger; easier to hit, and heal the Evoker for 5 hearts if they damage the player. Added visual cue for effect.
* Evoker health increased to 50 hearts from 12. Evoker Fangs now inflict Slowness for 10 seconds. If the Evoker takes more than 4 hearts of damage in a single attack, there will be a 50% chance to spawn an additional vex. If the Evoker takes more than 8 hearts of damage in a single attack, there will be a 100% chance to spawn an additional vex, and it will heal for 2 hearts. If you attack the Evoker from further than 10 blocks, the Evoker will warp you to its location and heal for 4 hearts.
* Creepers move slightly faster, track players through walls, detonate without line of sight, and turn certain natural blocks in its explosion radius to moss.
* Zombies have increased reinforcement rates, increased follow range, 25% knockback resistance, their health increased to 15 hearts, and will seek out and break torches. Baby Zombies are larger by 25%, their health has been reduced to 5 hearts, their movement speed has been reduced, but their reinforcement rate is even higher.
* Spiders scurry quickly towards the player after taking damage. If close enough, spiders can latch onto their heads and begin to bite them, slowing them down, dealing damage, and healing themselves. Only a single spider can ride a player at a given time. Spiders may fall off when damaged or killed.
* Bats are now aggressive mobs. When a player is within their follow range, they will chase the player with bites that have a 20% chance to blind for 4 seconds. However, bats can also be temporarily tamed in the presence of glow berries. Any player holding the item will not be attacked, with the bats opting to follow you instead. If you feed a bat, it will become peaceful for 5 minutes. Continuing to feed bats also has a 20% chance to reward the player with a random seed drop.
* Husks' hunger draining attacks have been greatly strengthened. Husks also exude a slowing aura around them, that disables sprinting.
* Elder Guardians have 60 hearts of health, and several new attack patterns. When attacked, the Elder Guardian will release several homing spikes that inflict a new effect called Anchored for 15 seconds. Anchored prevents swimming, and greatly increases gravity while in water. The Elder Guardian can also inflict Anchored with its beam attack, for 15 seconds. For every quarter of health lost, it will release several normal Guardians to help it in battle, and shrink 10%. And lastly, the Elder Guardian can destroy any blocks trapping it and fill their space with water source blocks.

## Also working on a bunch of systems too! Like new tool tiers and mechanics and man, I love programming!
